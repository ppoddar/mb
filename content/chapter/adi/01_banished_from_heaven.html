 King <span class="glossary-term">Mahavish</span>
 belonged to <span class="glossary-term">Ekshaku</span> clan. 
 He earned the right to enter heaven being a host to many ceremonies.
<br>
 Once Mahavish was invited to a party in heaven by none
 other than <span class="glossary-term">Brahma</span> - the chief architect of the universe. 
<br>
 Beautiful <span class="glossary-term">Ganga</span> - the goddess of the greatest river - 
 was also present in Bramha's party. 
 Suddenly a gust of wind blew away Ganga's robe (the first recorded incidence
 of <em>wardrobe malfunction</em>). The gods averted their gaze, but Mahavish could
 not take his eyes off resplendent nude beauty of Ganga. 
<br>
 Brahma grew angry with Mahavish. He cursed him: "You wretched man! Go lost!! Go back to earth. You may return to heaven
 only after you lived a human life". <br>
 Mahavish chose to be born on earth as
 <span class="glossary-term">Shantanu</span>,
 son of King Prateep. Shantanu was the emperor after seven generations from Kuru.

<h6>Ganga meets the OctoBasus</h6>
 Ganga was returning to earth after the fateful party of Bramha.
 Mahavish's admiring eyes still lingering in her mind. On her way back, she noticed
 a group of angels huddled at the wayside. She was curious. 
<br>
<a name="octobasus">
 The angels said: "We, eight of us, are <span class="glossary-term">OctoBasus</span>. 
 Saint <span class="glossary-term">Vashishta</span> cursed
 us to human life. But we do not wish to enter a human womb. Will you please give
 birth to us?"
  <br>
  Ganga agreed to OctoBasus' request.
  <br>
 "Let us be born as sons of emperor Shantanu": OctoBasus suggested. 
 <br>  
 They wished for more: "We are <em>not</em> looking forward to live entire human life.
 Human life sucks. Can you please throw us in the river as soon as we are born?"
 <br>  
 Ganga agreed, conditionally: "I can do that. But what about the emperor, my husband? 
 He would want at least one son from our union. Won't he?". 
 <br>
   OctoBasus said: "Let each of us contribute one-eighth of our sperm for a son. 
   He can live and will be strong, but ... he will be <em>infertile</em>".
