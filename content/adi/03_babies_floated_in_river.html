One day, young <span class="glossary">Shantanu</span> was roaming in the banks of river Ganga.
He noticed an exquisite woman in a golden dress.
Shantanu was enchanted by her. 
</p>

<p> 
 Shantanu approached her: "Oh my beauty, who are
 you? A goddess, or a mere mortal? Whoever you are, will you please marry me?". 
</p>

<p>    
 The lady replied:"I am Ganga. 
 I can be your wife. But on <em>one condition</em>. 
 You must not resist any of my actions, 
 be it good or evil.
 If you ever object, I will leave you ". 
</p>

<p>    
 Shantanu, enchanted by the mysterious
 woman, agreed. 
</p>

<hr class="rounded">
<p>    
 Shantanu was happy with his charming and caring new wife. They together
 had eight babies, all boys, all handsome as angels. 
</p>

<p>    
 But every time, his wife threw
 the newborn into the river just after birth. Shantanu was irked by her strange
 act, but he did not resist. 
   </p>

<p> 
 Nevertheless, he could not help himself for the eighth newborn."Please
 do not throw the baby in the water": he pleaded to her. "Why
 do you reject the babies every time. Why?" 
</p>

<p> 
 His wife smiled: "You want a son, I know.
 I will not throw this newborn away to the river. But my days with you have now come to
 an end". 
</p>

<p> 
 Then she revealed her identity, told him about the curse of OctoBasus...</a>
 </p>

<hr class="rounded">
 
  <div class="story">
  Once OctoBasus and their wives went on a vacation to 
  <span class="glossary">Sumeru</span>
  mountain near Saint <span class="glossary">Vashistha</span>'s meditation retreat. 
  <br>
  The wife of <span class="glossary">DuyBasu</span> - one of the OctoBasus - 
  saw <span class="glossary">Nandini</span> - the
  amazing cow that granted every wish of its owner - grazing on the campus. 
  <br>
  DuyBasu's wife liked the cow so much that she must gift it to her friend
  <span class="glossary">Jitabati</span>.
  <br>    
  She insisted husband so much that finally DuyBasu had to steal the cow. 
  <br>
  Saint Vashishta was not present 
  at the campus at that time. But once he returned and found theÂ cow missing, he was
  furious. 
  <br>
  He cursed: "Whoever has stolen my Nandini will be born as human".
   <br>
  OctoBasu apologized and begged Saint Vashishta to retract his curse. 
   <br>
  Vashishta calmed down a bit: "OK, you will be free of the curse within an year".
   
  <br>
  "But not him": Vashishta said, pointing at DuyBasu: 
  "He must serve the sentence of a <em>full</em> human life. 
  But... it will be a pious life of a wise man who would be dear to his father
  and free of sexual temptation".

 <hr class="rounded">

 After narrating the tale of
 of OctoBasus, Ganga told Shantanu: "O my beloved king, I had thrown the newborns
 to the river every time because they were OctoBasus reincarnated, 
 and they wished to return to heaven as
 soon as possible. 
 But this eighth newborn is DuyBasu - he must live a human man life 
 before he can reenter heaven". 
   <br>
 Then she took the newborn with her and disappeared into her own river.
