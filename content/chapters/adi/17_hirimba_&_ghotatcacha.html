    <span class="glossary">Hirimb</span>  - a daemon lived in a teak tree nearby where Kunti and other Pandavas
    were asleep. His color of skin was like dark cloud, eyes yellow, hair and beard red, jaws 
    clenched, shape dangerous. Looking at the Pandavas he wished to eat human flesh. He told 
    his sister <span class="glossary">Hirimba</span>:"After a long period, my favorite food 
    has arrived. I am salivating in its smell, my tounge is coming out. Today will tear open
    soft human flesh in my teeth , will drink their blood from their neck. You kill them 
    and bring to me, today we two will rejoice human flesh.
    Hirimba, on her brother's command, jumped the trees to find them all asleep besides one.
    Looking at mighty, muscular, resplondant Bhim, she thought he is fit to be my husband.
    Amorous love is superior to brotherly love - I will not follow my brother's order.
    Hirimba bedecked with jewels approached Bhim and said demurely: "Oh my lord, who are you?
    Where have you come from? These sleeping angelic men and woman, who are they? In this
    forest lives a daemon named Hirimb. He desires human flesh. That is why he has sent 
    me. But I have fallen in love for you. Please be my husband. I can fly in the sky. 
    We will roam freely in the sky". 
    <p></p>
    Bhim said: "Who can leave sleeping mother and brothers in the clutches of the daemons?"
    <p></p>
    Hirimba said: "Wake them up. I wll save them all"
    <p></p>
    Bhim said:"They are sound asleep. I will not disturb their sleep now. Either you stay or go
    or bring your brother. I can tackle anyone be it angel or daemon.
    <p></p>
    Hirimb rushed in as his sister was getting delayed. Hirimba said : "you all hold on to my
    back. I will fly you away"
    <p></p>
    Bhim said: "Don't worry. Do not underestimate me being human"
    <hr class="dashed">
    Hirimb arrived and found his sister morphed into a beautiful woman wearing fine cloth, jewels
    and garland. He was enraged. "You are debauch of a girl. I wll destroy you too with them". 
    <p></p>
    Bhim said: "Why to wake them up. come to me instead. What is the fault to your sister? 
    She is inspired by the formless Eros who lives inside our body to be attracted to me."
    <p></p>
    Then Bhim and Hirimb engaged in a massive hand fight. Bhim pulled Hirimb away futher away
    from his brother lest their sleep gets disturbed, however all woke up at the sound of the 
    fight. 
    <p></p>  
    Kunti asked Hirimba:"Oh beautiful lady! Who are you? Angel or godess of the forest? " 
    <p></p>
    Hirimba told her identity and said that she had fallen in love with Bhim.

    Arjun told Bhim
