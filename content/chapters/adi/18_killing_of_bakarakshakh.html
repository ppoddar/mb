    The Pandavas used to dwell in the bramhin's house. Whatever they collected daily by
    begging , Kunti used to divide in two portions - one half was for Bhim only. The other
    four brothers and Kunti shared the other portion. Many days passed in this fashion.
    <p></p>
    One day, Yudhisthir etcetra had gone out begging, only Kunti and Bhim were at home, 
    they heard wails at their host's house. 
    <p></p>
    Kunti went inside and found the bramhin sitting morosely with his wife and daughter.
    The bramhin was saying:"Shame on a man whose life which is in other's control. it is the root
    of all woes. I wanted to migrate to a safe place. but you unfortunately did not want to 
    leave your parent's house, now this family will be destroyed because of that.
    <p></p>
    I can neither desert my loving wife, nor can I leave my son or daughter; if I 
    sacrifice my life, all of you will die too. Alas! what will happen to us? Let us die
    all of us together!"
    <p></p>
    The bramhin's wife said: "Why are you wailing like an ordinary man? One wants a family for oneself.
    You stay back. I will go. Then I will earn goodwill in this life and fortune for the other 
    life as well. A man wants a family from his better half. You have got that. But I can not pay for 
    their upkeep. Everyone covets for an woman without huband as birds hanker for meat fallen
    on the ground. The crooked men might deviate me from righteous path, how will I arrange for 
    our daughter's marriage or the son's training ? 
    You will get another woman in my absence , but for me it would be a great sin to get another
    husband. Hence let me go.
    <p></p>
    The bramhin hugged his wife and shed tears. Then 
    the daughter said: "You have to let me give away someday anyway. So let me go now. All of us will
    be saved and I will attain heaven too". The young kid heartily said: " Do not cry. I will
    kill the daemon with this straw "
    <p></p>Kunti asked : "What is the cause of your worry? Will resolve the matter if we can". 
    <p></p>The bramhin said:"A mighty daemon named <span class="glossary">Bak</span> lives near this 
    city. He is the master of this city. The king lives in the palace at <span class="glossary">
        Baitrakriyogriha.</span> But the king is ignorant and weak. He does not know how to 
        save his subjects. The Bak Rakskaskh only saves this land. As his price , everyday 
        we have to send a man with plenty of food and a couple of buffalos to him. Bak Rakskaskh
        eats that man, buffalos and the food. 
        <p></p>Today is my turn. But I do not have sufficient wealth to buy a man to send him to 
        the daemon. Hence we will all go to him as a whole family, let him devour all of us.
        <p></p>"Do not worry about that. One of my five sons will go on your behalf": Kunti said.
        <p></p>"You are our brahmin guests. Your son can not die for us"
        <p></p>"My son is mighty resourceful.He will be able to return after delivering the food. 
        But you will not divulge to anyone. They will disturb my son"
        <p></p>The bramhin was very pleased at Kunti's assurance. 
        <p></p>Yudhisthir then returned home. Listening to Kunti's assurance to the bramhin, he 
        said:"Why are you sacrificing Bhim whose might let us sleep in peace in the night, who 
        saved us from the fire at the house of lac? "
        <p></p>Kunti said :"Bhim is as powerful as the ten thousand elephants, no one is mightier 
        than him. Our duty is to return the favor of the bramhin in whose house we are living 
        safely".
        <p></p>On the day break, Bhim went with the food to the forest where bakrakshak lived
        and called him by name. He came enraged and saw Bhim eating his food. 
        <p></p>"Who dares to eat my food in front of me? " Bhim kept on eating and laughing. He 
        hit Bhim on the back with both hands but Bhim did not care. The rakshak attacked Bhim 
        with an uprooted tree. Bhim finished his food and caught the tree with his left hand. 
        Then both were engaged in a fist fight and Bhim killed him smashing him to the ground.
        The family of the rakshak came outof the cave at his cries. 
        <p></p>"Never ever hate humans. If you do, you too will lose your life". They obeyed 
        Bhim's order. Then Bhim left the corpse of the rakshak at the city gate and returned
        home unnoticed. 
        <p></p>The citizens came surprised to ask the bramhin. The bramhin said:"A great soul
        went to deliver the food on out behalf. He must have killed the rakshak for good of 
        all of us".
