    Duryadhan consulted his uncle <em>Shakuni</em> and friend <em>Karna</em> on
    downfall of Pandavas. He told Dhritarashtra : "The citizens want Yudhisthir as king,
    ignoring you or Vishma. You did not become king because of your blindness; Pandu did.
    But if the Pandavas inhrit the kingdom, we will be ignored forever. You trick the 
    Pandavas to <em>Baranabat</em>, then we will not be worried anymore".
    <p></p>
    Dhritarashtra said: Pandu was liked by his subjects, Yudhisthir had also become like 
    Pandu. He has support too, how can I excile him? Vishma, Drona, Bidur or Kripa will
    not support it. 
    <p></p>
    Duryadhan said: I have influenced the sujects with wealth and position, the beaurocrats
    and traesury are on our side. Vishma is equivocal, Ashwathama is on our side, Drona will
    follow his son, Kripa will not go against his nephews. Bidur is sponsored by us, but 
    favours Pandavas. However, he can not stop us. You immediately arrange for Kunti and 
    Pandavas to go to Baranabat.
    <p></p>
    On Dhritarashtra's suggestion, a few ministers went to Pandavas and told them: 
    Baranabat is a wonderful city. Recently many have gathered in the city for an
    animal fare. The Pandavas also wished to visit the city. Dhritarashtra also said:
    Baranabat is a beautiful city. Go there, attend the fare, donate to the bramhins and   
    the singers, enjoy some vacation time.
<p></p>
    Yudhisthir agreed. He took Vishma's blessings and proceeded to visit Baranabat
    with his mother and brothers.
    <p></p>
    Dhritarashtra approached <em>Purochana</em>. He told him in private : You go
    to Baranabat immidiately by a fast chariot. Build a house there with lac and 
    oil and othe inflameable material. invite the Pandavas there and accommodate
    them in luxury. Later in the night, when the Pandavas are asleep peacefully, 
    <em>burn down the palace</em>.
    Purochana immediately went to Baranabat following Duryadhan's command.
    <p></p>
    Intelligent Bidur understood Duryadhan's ill intent. He and Yudhisthir both knew 
    tribal language. He told Yudhisthir in tribal tongue: one who knows the enemies'
    plan can also avoid them. Life can be destroyed even without arms. Fire burns 
    dry forest but the cavedwellers lives are saved. A man can save himself escaping
    through the burroughs like a hedgehog. The one who can navigate by the stars and 
    remembers his ways can save himself and five other lives.
    <p></p>
    Yudhisthir answered :"Understood". Later Kunti asked him: "Bidur spoke to you in 
    tribal language and you replied that you have understood. what have you talked about,
    what have you understood?"
    <p></p>
    Yudhisthir said:"Our home will catch fire. We must know all escape routes."
    <hr class="dashed">
    The people cheered as the Pandavas arrived in Baranabat, the Pandavas also paid 
    visit to their home. Purochana took them to a palace with funfare and arranged 
    for luxurious accommodation. After ten nights, he took them to another palace.
    Yudhisthir smelt lac in the new palace and told Bhim :the master craftsmen had 
    prepared this home with inflameable materials. The crooked Purochana wants 
    to burn us down.
    Bhim said:if you suspect foul play, let us return to the previous palace.
    Yudhisthir did not accept that idea. If Purochana finds out that we have
    suspected him, he will burn us all by force. If we run away, Duryadhan's spies 
    will kill us. Let us know all the routes aound this place. We would dig 
    tunnel in this house of lac , we would dwell there and no one can hear us 
    breathe.
    <hr class="dashed">
    At that time a man came to the Pandavas in secret and told them: I am adapt 
    at excavation, Bidur had sent me to you. I know what he told you in tribal
    language, that is the proof of my authenticity. Purochana would burn this 
    house up on fourteenth night of the moon, please tell me what can I do?
    <p></p>
    You wish us well as well as Bidur. Save us from burnout. Purochana had 
    already stashed lots of arms in the house , running away is impossible.
    Find a secret means to save us.
    <p></p>
    The man excavated a big tunnel inside the house, levelled its entrance door with 
    ground so no one can detect it.
    <p></p>
    The Pandavas hunted in the daytime in one forest or another and spent the night
    in the tunnel with weapons and remaining alert.
    <hr class="dashed">
    One year passed in this way. Purochana determined then the Pandavas were free of any 
    doubt further. Yudhisthir told the Pandavas: "The time for our escape has come. We will
    burn Purochana to death by night. Will leave leaving six other persons behind.
    <p></p>
    One day Kunti arranged a feast for the bramhins. A <em>Nishad</em> woman came to the 
    feast with her own five sons. They drank a lot and fell into deep slumber. In the 
    midnight, when everyone was deep asleep, Bhim torched Purochana's bed chember and in 
    all sides of house of lac. The five Pandavas and Kunti entered the tunnel, the house 
    of lac caught huge fire. The residents woke up in the heat and crackling sound. 'This 
    fire is torched by crooked Duryadhan to kill the Pandavas. Shame upon Dhritarashtra.
    By luck, Purochana is also burnt down.': they lamented.
    <hr class="dashed">
    The Pandavas and Kunti escaped through the tunnel unnoticed. A follower of Vidur kept
    a motorboat with flag waiting in the river. They crossed the river with the boat.
    Alighting the boat, the Pandavas went south navigating via the stars. They crossed 
    difficult terrain to reach dense forest of wild animals. Kunti and others were 
    thirsty. Bhim brought them water on soaked lotus leaves. Everyone fell asleep, only 
    Bhim stayed awake.
    <hr class="dashed">
    Next morning, the residents of Baranabat extinguished the fire to find Purochan dead. 
    In search of the Pandavas, they found the burnet corpse of Nishad woman and five sons,
    and thought that Kunti and five Pandavas had died in the fire. They did not notice 
    the tunnel as the excavator already filled it in.
    <p></p>
    Once the news reached Hastinapur, Dhritarashtra lamented a lot. He sent people for 
    last rites to Baranabat. Then they performed the last rites in Ganga with other 
    members of Kuru clan. Everyone cried, besides Vidur who did not express a lot.
