    Duryadhan consulted his uncle Subal's son,  <em>Shakuni</em> and <em>Karna</em> on
    downfall of Pandavas. He told Dhritarashtra : The citizens want Yudhisthir as king,
    ignoring you or Vishma. You did not become king because of your blindness; Pandu did.
    But if the Pandavas inhrit the kingdom, we will be ignored forever. You trick the 
    Pandavas to <em>Baranabat</em>, then we will not be worried anymore.
    <p></p>
    Dhritarashtra said: Pandu was liked by the subjects, Yudhisthir had also become like 
    Pandu. He has support too, how can I excile him? Vishma, Drona, Bidur or Kripa will
    not support it. 
    <p></p>
    Duryadhan said: I have influenced the sujects with wealth and position, the beaurocrats
    and traesury are on our side. Vishma is equivocal, Ashwathama is on our side, Drona will
    follow his son, Kripa will not go against his nephews. Bidur is sponsored by us, but 
    favours Pandavas. However, he can not stop us. You immediately arrange for Kunti and 
    Pandavas to go to Baranabat.
    <p></p>
    On Dhritarashtra's suggestion, a few ministers went to Pandavas and told them: 
    Baranabat is a wonderful city. Recently many hvave gathered in the city for an
    animal fare. The Pandavas also wished to visit the city. Dhritarashtra also said:
    Baranabat is a beautiful city. Go there, attend the fare, donate the bramhins and   
    the singers, enjoy some vacation time.
<p></p>
    Yudhisthir agreed. He took Vishma's blessings and proceeded to visit Baranabat
    with his mother and brothers.
    <p></p>
    Dhritarashtra approached <em>Purochana</em>. He told him in private : You go
    to Baranabat immidiately by a fast chariot. Build a palace there with lac and 
    oil and othe inflameable material. invite the Pandavas there and accommodate
    them in luxury. Later in the night, <em>burn down the palace</em>.
