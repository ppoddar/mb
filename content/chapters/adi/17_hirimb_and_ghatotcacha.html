    <span class="glossary">Hirimb</span>  - a daemon lived in a teak tree nearby where Kunti and other Pandavas
    were asleep. His color of skin was like dark cloud, eyes yellow, hair and beard red, jaws 
    clenched, shape dangerous. Looking at the Pandavas he wished to eat human flesh. He told 
    his sister <span class="glossary">Hirimba</span>:"After a long period, my favorite food 
    has arrived. I am salivating in its smell, my tounge is coming out. Today will tear open
    soft human flesh in my teeth , will drink their blood from their neck. You kill them 
    and bring to me, today we two will rejoice human flesh.
    Hirimba, on her brother's command, jumped the trees to find them all asleep besides one.
    Looking at mighty, muscular, resplondant Bhim, she thought he is fit to be my husband.
    Amorous love is superior to brotherly love - I will not follow my brother's order.
    Hirimba bedecked with jewels approached Bhim and said demurely: "Oh my lord, who are you?
    Where have you come from? These sleeping angelic men and woman, who are they? In this
    forest lives a daemon named Hirimb. He desires human flesh. That is why he has sent 
    me. But I have fallen in love for you. Please be my husband. I can fly in the sky. 
    We will roam freely in the sky". 
    <p></p>
    Bhim said: "Who can leave sleeping mother and brothers in the clutches of the daemons?"
    <p></p>
    Hirimba said: "Wake them up. I wll save them all"
    <p></p>
    Bhim said:"They are sound asleep. I will not disturb their sleep now. Either you stay or go
    or bring your brother. I can tackle anyone be it angel or daemon.
    <p></p>
    Hirimb rushed in as his sister was getting delayed. Hirimba said : "you all hold on to my
    back. I will fly you away"
    <p></p>
    Bhim said: "Don't worry. Do not underestimate me being human"
    <hr class="dashed">
    Hirimb arrived and found his sister morphed into a beautiful woman wearing fine cloth, jewels
    and garland. He was enraged. "You are debauch of a girl. I wll destroy you too with them". 
    <p></p>
    Bhim said: "Why to wake them up. come to me instead. What is the fault to your sister? 
    She is inspired by the formless Eros who lives inside our body to be attracted to me."
    <p></p>
    Then Bhim and Hirimb engaged in a massive hand fight. Bhim pulled Hirimb away futher away
    from his brother lest their sleep gets disturbed, however all woke up at the sound of the 
    fight. 
    <p></p>  
    Kunti asked Hirimba:"Oh beautiful lady! Who are you? Angel or godess of the forest? " 
    <p></p>
    Hirimba identifield herself and said that she had fallen in love with Bhim. 
    <p></p>
    Arjun told Bhim: Please don't delay further. We got to go. Dawn is nearing. This is 
    moment the daemons get stronger. Let us not toy with the daemon any further ; kill
    it immediately.
    Then Bhim lifted Hirimb up and rotated him overhead. Then he squashead him to the ground
    killing him in the process.
    <p></p>
    Arjun said :"I think the city is not far from here. Let us get there soon. Durodhyana will
    not be able to find us."
    <p></p>
    Bhim said:"Hirimba, daemons are known to betray by illusion. You follow your brother's fate."
    Kunti intervened:"Please do not kill a woman. She will  not harm us."
    <p></p>
    Hirimb bowed to Kunti. "I have left my kin to accept your son as husband. I wll not live if you
    refuse me. Please have mercy on me as a loyal disciple. Let me mate your son. I will roam freely
    with  you. But will come back as soon as you recall me."
    <p></p>
    Yudhisthir said:"Hirimb, you make a fair point. You obey the following discipline: Bhim wll go out
    with you after bath and breakfast , but you return him before sunset"
    <p></p>
    Bhim said:"I will  go out with you until you beget a son". Hirimb agreed and they took off to the 
    skies. 
    <p></p>
    Soon Hirimb bore a massive, mighty son. Its ear pin-pointed, teeth sharp as needle, lips are 
    color of copper and voice terrible. The gestation period for daemons are short. Hirimba's son
    mastered all the arms soon after birth. Hirimb named him <span class="glossary">Ghatotcacacha
    </span>"  
    <p></p>
    He bowed down to Kunti and the Pandavas:"Please let me know what I am to do."
    <p><</p>
    Kunti said: "You are born in a Kuru family. You are like Bhim, you in fact the fist born of 
    the Pandavas. You help us"
    <p></p>
    "I will always be at your service. I will appear a soon as I am needed". He took their leave 
    for northern mountains. 
    <p><</p>
    The Pandavas like hermits wore deer hide and traversed the land of <span>Matsya</span>, <span>
        Trigarta</span>, <span>Panchal</span> and <span>Keechak</span>. On their way, they met 
    their grandfather- Vyaasa. "I know everything that had happened to you. Do not be saddened.
    You will see good time. You dwell in disguise until we meet again". Hence Vyaasa left 
    the Pandavas in a bramhin's house at <span class="glossary">Ekachakrya</span>
