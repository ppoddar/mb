    Later another bramhin guest arrived at the bramhin's house where the Pandavas were staying.
    He infomed them of <span class=glossary">swamvar</span> ceremony of <span class="glossary">
        Draupadi</span>. He told them in details 
<div class="story">
    Drupad was eager for revenge after his defeat to Drona. One day he arrived at a colony of
    the bramhins near the banks of Ganga and Yamuna. Two hermits <span>Jazz</span> and <span>UpaJazz</span>
    stayed in the colony. 
    <p></p>Drupad pleased UpaJazz by caressing his feet. "I will donate you ten crore cattles. 
    You get me a son who will slain Drona". UpaJazz did not agree. Still Drupad kept serving 
    him. After a year, UpaJazz told him :"you request my elder brother Jazz. He does not 
    discriminate clean and unclean. I have seen him pick up food fallen on the ground. He 
    used to eat others' leftover food during hostel days. I think he desires wealth, he will 
    organize ritual for a son for you for money". 
    <p></p>Drupad requested Jazz despite his lack of respect for him. Jazz consented and 
    took UpaJazz as his assistant.
    <p></p>Once the ritual is over, Jazz called for the queen:"Oh Queen, come and join. Your two
    sons are here." 
    <p></p>The queen said:"I have not washed my face. And am yet to take bath. You wait"
    <p></p>"I am performing the lst rites to the ritual, UpaJazz is reciting the mantras.
    The ritual will soon be fulfilled whether you join or not." 
    <p></p>As soon as Jazz finished the last offereings to the fire, a mighty, armored son
    emerged from the fire with a roar. The citizens of <em>Panchal</em> cheered , the gods 
    declared from the heaven:"This son will slain Drona". 
    After that from the fir emerged <em>Panchalee</em>. She was good looking , dark, well 
    breasted, lotus eyed, curly haired, her fragrance can be smelt from miles away. 
    <p></p>The heaven announced : "She is the best among women. She will be the cause of 
    great ruin for <em>Khatriyas</em> in general and clan of <em>Kuru</em> in particular".
    <p></p>Drupad and his wife were very pleased.
    <p></p>The son and the daughter were named <em>DhrishtaDumnya</em> and <em>Krishna</em>. 
    Drona, aware of inevitability of fate, brought DhrishtaDumnya own home and trained him 
    in weaponary.

The Pandavas were sad to listen to the story. "We have lived at the bramhin's house for long. 
We have not seen the neighbouring sights. Also beggings are becoimg less and less ": Kunti told
Yudhishthira:"If you all wish, let us go to Panchal". Then Vyaasa came again to meet them.
