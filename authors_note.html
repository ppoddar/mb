            Mahabharath by KrishDwapiyan Vyaas is one of the greatest ancient Indian texts.
            To read the epic in translation in entireity is difficult for common reader.
            For the curious, the entire epic is an invaluable treasure of ancient culture,
            none of it parts is ignoreable. But for common reader wishing to read the essential
            narrative, many ancillaries and backstories are mere hinderances.

            discussions, hymns and oftrepeated parts and boring parts are smmarized or ommitted.

            present the epic in an easy-to-read manner.
